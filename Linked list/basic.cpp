/*linked list is a dynamic data structure that is collection of nodes.
It consists of data nd the address of the next data.
why we need LL?
In case of arrays, they are of fixed size.at run tym we cant increase the size of array.
In case of vactors, we know that in case of more elements than vector size since it is dynamic in nature ,at run time it double 
its size and allocate a new memory for that vector and copy all the values in it.
But it not a optimised approach as memory is wasting. 
LL is a dynamic Data structure in which we can grow and shrink the size at run time without wastage of memory

4 types of LL:
1. Singly LL
2. Doubly LL
3. circular LL
4. circular Doubly LL 

1. header linked list -> used for creation of multiple linked list at a tym by taking header as a refrence
